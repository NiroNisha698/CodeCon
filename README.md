Problem:-
As the curfew continues even though if city people work from home they order their goods online and purchase things. What about
the village side?? There are farmers, fisherman etc who are staying home without going to work. Therefore there is shortage
of money where they are suffering to buy their basic needs like food, sanitary napkins etc. why shouldn’t there be a solution ??
Solution:-
People and organizations who want to help the pandemic can donate the amount they wish to donate through our website. Donations
where they will know who are getting there donations. So that everyone will have a trust.
